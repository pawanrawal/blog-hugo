For a long time I have wanted to setup my blog and share my learnings. This week I got down to getting it done. Through this post I want to help you setup your blog on your website.

There are multitude of ways of setting up your blog, you could set it up on Wordpress or just write posts on Medium. The method that I am going to outline below would mostly suit developers.

Sometime ago I came across this [post](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/domain-registrars-dns-and-hosting-353e4163a19#.b3jca1giu) on Medium. Its an excellent post which outlines the various steps needed to setup your blog. I will reiterate those points here for you.

* Get a domain name - I had bought my domain from Go Daddy, but then I transferred it to namecheap because the UI is much easier to work with.
